## Abstract:

EXTRA EXTRA, READ ALL ABOUT IT! Front page is a simple web application in which you can see and sort through today's top headlines with a simple interface. Feel free to take a look at the first couple lines of the article or view it in full with front page!

## Context:

This was an individual project during Mod 3 at Turing School of Software & Design using the [provided comp](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_fe).

## Learning Goals:
- Complete a basic React in a efficient manner
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Test React components & asynchronous JS E2E using Cypress
- Create a multi-page UX using Router
- Learn to deploy an application (with environmental variables)

## Challenges:
- User  Experience: This application utilizes a News API. The GET request occurs on the home page and data is passed down in the form of props. This means that if an individual reloads a page requiring that data to render an error will be thrown. I had to create a better user experience for this type of issue under time constraints. Thus if a user reloads the page when viewing an article they will automatically be routed back to the home page.

## Installation Instructions:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone it to your local machine using the green `<> CODE` button and paste that into your terminal with the command: `git clone <paste here>`
3. Run the command: `cd front-page`
4. Run the command: `npm install`
5. Run the command: `npm start`
6. The application will open in your browser

## Ideas for future iterations 
- Improve the search, sort, and filter functionality taking advantage of news outlets in other countries or networks
- Continue to improve the UI
